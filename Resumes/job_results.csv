We're looking for a data scientist to help us make that vision a reality by developing and refining cutting-edge machine learning models and data processing systems.

Our outside sales product helps outside sales users — salespeople who visit the customers they sell to — do their jobs more effectively. You'll help build predictive models and use data to give them insights into their customers and across their sales portfolios. Our outside sales product, for example, uses machine learning for free-text product search using custom language models.

We are not looking to build a series of basic linear regressions with SciKit learn... Our data science group works with cutting-edge neural network architectures and other high-power machine learning techniques to solve deep problems with elegant solutions for our users. We believe deep solutions to big problems help solve the real problems our users face in their work.

This position reports to the lead engineer on the outside sales team. The data science group also regularly meets across teams (including our CTO). We have a journal club that meets regularly to discuss interesting ideas, we push to explore cutting-edge research, and we encourage collaboration across teams. You'll also have a chance to regularly speak with users to gain domain knowledge and tailor your ideas.

Our machine learning work mostly happens in Python using TensorFlow and Keras. Our infrastructure team works with the data science group on tooling for model training, testing, and deployment. We have a microservice architecture that makes working with data easy and secure. Familiarity with some programming and machine learning techniques is essential, but familiarity with these specific toolsets is not.

This role is for immediate start. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.

Senior Data Scientist,Drizly,"New York, NY",via Lever,"Who we are

Drizly is the world’s largest alcohol marketplace and the best way to shop beer, wine and spirits. Our customers trust us to be part of their lives – their celebrations, parties, dinners and quiet nights at home. We are there when it matters - committed to life’s moments and the people who create them. We partner with the best retail stores in over 1300 cities across North America to serve up the best buying experience. Drizly offers a huge selection and competitive pricing with a side of personalized content. That is what we do. Who we are is a different story.

We are more than just another tech company. There is an intellectual curiosity that occurs at Drizly. We have a desire to question, to understand, to figure it out. Bottom line, we solve it. We value not just the truth but the process to get to the truth, to deliberate, decide and then act. Most importantly, we care. We care about our customer. We care about our company. We care about our team. There will be long... days and incredible challenges.

We are blazing a trail in an industry that hasn’t changed in nearly a century, and that doesn’t scare us (well, not all the time) -and even when it does, it doesn’t stop us, it energizes us.

Do you see yourself here? Read on.

Who you are

You have raised the technical bar as a Data Scientist and have improved processes for productionizing models. You are comfortable and experienced in creating models that drive performance for complex use cases and operate with industry best practices.

You have partnered with a data science team and have mentored team members. You built out core data products with a solid foundation for others to build on.

You have worked in previous environments that partnered seamlessly with Product and Data Engineering teams. You have worked with non-technical stakeholders and teams and are comfortable talking through technical concepts in a digestible way. You know when to stop tuning and push code to production. You have a solid understanding of user segmentation and what its downstream use cases will be. It would be great if you have worked on either on-site search optimization or personalization.

You love working with teams including Data Engineering and Business Intelligence to transform raw data into highly actionable business insights through Looker, as well as partnering with retention marketing and product teams to turn those insights into action. You also know how to work the other direction - how to implement and manage retention initiatives to ensure that data collection is seamless and comprehensive. You have a proven track record designing, implementing, and measuring solutions in the analytics space, and you have lead projects that have delivered results.

What the role is

Personalization is a key part of our consumer facing strategy over the next few years. Personalization in Data Science is best built via collaboration of people and the cohesion of multiple processes into a unified user experience. In order to execute at the rate that we need to, we will need to bring additional resources to the team.

This role will work with a variety of teams including Analytics, Data Engineering, and Product to build out our internal Data Science products. Personalization requires inputs from every part of the organization to succeed and this individual won’t be the only person working in their space.

The company needs to execute quickly and the space we are working in has an infinite capacity for fine-tuning and improvement. It’s easy to get lost in making things slightly better instead of pushing it live.
This role will be interacting with many different systems, many different data types, and stakeholders with competing priorities. This person will need to be able to pull out the common thread from all of those things and choose the happy path.

This is a complicated space that needs creative and insightful solutions on a regular basis. This person will need to hold a lot of things in their head at once and bring to the table their own set of ideas as well. We would like them to come up with something that nobody has thought to apply here at Drizly.
We want this person to be comfortable doing something they’ve never done before and learn from it right away. A lot of the work has never been done at Drizly and they will be building things for the first time. They need to fail quickly and learn from their failure.

The Senior Data Scientist is a critical member of the Analytics organization, and will work closely with Data Engineering and BI, as well as the cross-functional Retention Growth team. They will certainly be responsible for supporting individual campaigns and product solutions, but also for the larger vision of how a data science architecture, codebase, and best practices for consumer retention should grow with Drizly over time. Ultimately, this person will determine the ground truth, roadmap, and reporting lens through which Drizly will be enabled to deliver memorable and relevant experiences for our customers.

Please note: this role can be performed remotely anywhere in the United States with the exception of Colorado.

You do you.

Drizly is an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status

BEFORE YOU APPLY...

We ask that you please remove all identifying information from your resume before you upload it on the next page in an effort to help us remove unconscious bias from our resume review process.

Business Analyst/Data Scientist Needed for Growing Solar Startup,Solar Lead Factory,Anywhere,via Openings At Solar Lead Factory,"“...solar power will be the single largest source of electricity generation… People do not understand the magnitude of the business. It’s really very, very significant.”

- Elon Musk

Once a fringe thing hippies did, “going solar” is now going mainstream. It took over 30 years for the first 1 million solar installations to be completed. It only took another 3 years to install the second million. Over the next 2 years another 1 million homes will “go solar” and there are 90 million American households to go after that! Solar technology is cheaper, better and more reliable than ever. Unless your head is buried in a coal mine, it’s becoming abundantly clear that solar is the future.

With rapid growth & mainstream adoption comes massive investment and opportunity in the space. Installation companies are growing quickly, making them hungry for even more growth, and solar continues to accelerate even in a post-COVID world. The last thing you want is the power going out during a quarantine... and it’s also a product that saves people money, enhances family security, and can be sold over the phone. The technology is dialed, the installation process is clean, but it’s still a challenge to find customers. Since customers that convert into sales are the lifeblood of any company, sales leads are the raw tool that unleashes massive growth for solar installers.

Finding qualified customers: that’s what we do at SolarLeadFactory.
About Us:

SolarLeadFactory has helped nearly 1 million homeowners looking to buy solar. We have helped hundreds of solar installers grow their businesses - and aim to help hundreds more.

Don't be fooled by our name: we're more than just a 'lead-gen company'. Our business is built on a proprietary software platform allowing us to deliver a best in class product and innovate constantly. We have in-house developers, digital marketing experts, and scientists relentlessly driving the product forward.

Our mission: to unlock consumer demand for solar power.
About You:

You’re looking for a way to make a huge positive difference in the world & help the companies on the front lines of the solar revolution!

You want to be part of a small but driven team making a big impact on one of the most pressing issues of our time. You share some of our core values including “Making Learning the Key Metric”, “Holding Yourself Accountable”, “Always be Testing Something,” and “Master your Craft”.

Most importantly, you love working with data and applying your expertise to specific business problems.

We believe at some level every business becomes a data science problem, and as a marketplace with tens to hundreds of millions of data points we’ve got some big meaty problems to chew on.

In order to be successful in this position you must be skilled, highly organized, efficient, proactive, analytical, tech savvy, and an excellent communicator.

Do you want to learn? To grow? To make a difference?
Critical Skills:
• Skill and experience with business analysis/data science applied to specific business cases
• Proficiency and experience with modern data tools & infrastructure (e.g. Mode, S3/Redshift, Fivetran/Stitch/Segment, dbt)
• Proficiency and experience in relevant programming languages for modeling/data visualization (Required: SQL, Highly Valuable: Python, R)
• Extremely Desirable: Proficiency and experience with predictive analytics models, statistical modeling, econometrics, complex marketplace analysis, or related fields.
• Solar experience is not required, but an interest in solar is
• Efficient, fast-moving, doer
• Ambition to grow
• Problem solving, ability to find solutions, and getting things done
• Excellent verbal & written skills
• Be tech savvy and comfortable with modern software solutions & platforms
• Ability to maintain equanimity in trying situations
• Ability to work with a team to find great solutions

Your Mission:

If you’re excited by ‘diving into the data’ and developing models that drive huge business action, this role is for you. Day to day could include everything from building predictive analytic models to managing the development of our increasingly complex marketplace algorithms.

You will be asked to help pull and prepare data sets as well as use these to answer one-off and ongoing questions about specific business cases (e.g. churn rate of a particular customer type).

You will help us sniff out where the 80/20 impact could be for effective action to grow the company, based on your analysis. And you will help us standardize our data and access to it using the best infrastructure and tools that we can put together.

You will be supported by and work with our entire team, including a small but extremely competent software engineering team, the founders/CEO, and anyone else on our team who gets directly into the data.
What you get out of this:
• Competitive salary
• Results driven organization
• Remote location - work from anywhere on a North American time zone
• Your input matters! We look for the BEST. Period.
• Work in an amazing industry. Your friends & family will say “woah, that’s cool!”
• Fast-growing, fun-loving company. Get on the rocketship now!

We are shaking up our industry and working day in and day out to get solar on everyone’s roof. Come shape your future & the future of the world.
