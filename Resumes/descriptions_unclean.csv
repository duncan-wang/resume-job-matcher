You will work broadly across Google’s Platforms Engineering, Systems Infrastructure, and Site Reliability Engineering teams to optimize our deployment of resources and drive innovation in our software stack, allowing for efficient use of resources.

As a Data Scientist, you will think critically and strategically about Google’s cloud as a technology, a business, and as an operation.

• Collaborate with the Centers of Excellence to design programs with end state analysis in mind (i.e., talent acquisition, performance management, compensation, etc).
• Develop compelling, logically structured presentations that can synthesize complex data into clear, actionable next steps.
• Keep up-to-date and introducing latest trends from technology, people analytics, and data science research to inform our team’s strategy.

What we look for in you (ie. Job Requirements)
• 8-10+ years relevant experience covering: building and managing high performing analytical teams, statistical techniques, advanced research design, and analytics/decision sciences with expertise in predictive modeling, time series forecasting, natural language processing (content and sentiment analysis), network analysis, machine learning, data mining, etc.

AI Success Director: DRGov (Cleared),DataRobot,"Washington, DC",via DataRobot,"DataRobot Government

DataRobot’s Government team serves leaders solving the most important public sector missions like the COVID response and military readiness. DataRobot is a leading AI company that seeks to enable the government to use AI as an organic, in-house capability.

What you would do in AI Success (AIS)

You lead DataRobot and client teams to achieve AI-enabled missions and organization transformations around AI. If there is an organizational or technical obstacle along the way, you rally others to overcome it while showing the way as an individual contributor. This is a difficult challenge as most (non-DataRobot) efforts to deploy AI fail, and when they do succeed, opportunity remains unmet.
• Deploy AI missions end-to-end, starting from roadmapping potential AI use cases, charting out the path to deploy priorities, and finally, getting the deployment done.
• Inspire the art-of-the-possible with clients, illustrating the path to get there
• Coach both client leaders and... AI-users on enabling their missions through organizational learning and growth
• Link client voice and vision to the DataRobot platform, work with R&D to advance client-centric product development, and build out our “practice” areas (e.g. financial management, talent, cybersecurity, etc.)

Successful AIS Director candidates typically bring:
• Management Consulting experience at the team-lead level (e.g. manager, project leader, etc.) developing strategies and coaching clients on overcoming difficult conceptual or organizational obstacles.
• Broad professional exposure demonstrating team leadership, multidimensional problem-solving, and ability to learn new knowledge and skills rapidly. Profile examples have included retired military leaders, former C-suite executives and other business leaders, entrepreneurs, legal team leads, or scholars of topics like organizational change.
• Passion for some of the mission areas our clients will likely face (in public service, healthcare, countering COVID, or innovation in industries like banking or airlines)
• BA/BS degree and very often an advanced degree (MBA, JD, PhD, MA)

If you are in the ballpark, apply - AIS Manager and Partner roles may also be available.

Candidates need not be versed in artificial intelligence prior to their interview process, but they should aim to learn through the interview process. If hired, DataRobot will provide further AI learning opportunities.

Citizenship and Clearance Requirements:
• Must be a US person
• Active TS/SCI clearance with polygraph and a current BI.
• Note: Two other variations of this role exist, differentiated only by clearance requirements, Defense TS/SCI only and normal (non-cleared)

Data Scientist - Recent Graduate,Vectra AI,"San Jose, CA (+1 other)",via ZipRecruiter,"Vectra Networks delivers a new class of advanced threat defense that delivers real-time detection and analysis of active network intrusions. Vectra technology picks up where perimeter security leaves off by providing deep, continuous analysis of both internal and Internet-facing network traffic to automatically detect all phases of a breach as attackers attempt to spy, spread, and steal within your network.

Vectra directly analyzes network traffic in real time using a patent-pending combination of data science, machine learning, and behavioral analysis to detect attacker behaviors and user anomalies in the network. All detections are correlated and prioritized to show an attack in context, and Vectra Networks' machine learning adapts as attacks evolve.Position Overview
